== Log Files
A typical log file looks like the following:
```

=== Custom Labels in Log File
Sometimes you may need to add some custom metadata like build number or branch name to Selenium logs. Just add the following capability to your tests:

.Type: map, format: "<key>": "<value>"
----
labels: {"buildNumber": 122, "branch": "feature-XXX"}
----

With this capability browser column will look like this:
```
[firefox-42.0 buildNumber=122 branch=feature-XXX]
```
Such additional metadata in logs allows to better analyze respective Selenium sessions.
