== Proxying Downloaded Files

Similarly to proxying video files Ggr is able to return any files downloaded by browser in **running** Selenium session.

. Downloaded files are expected to be stored on the hub hosts and accessible via the following URL:

    http://hub-host.example.com:4444/download/<real-session-id>/filename.txt

+
Such notation for example is supported by http://aerokube.com/selenoid/latest[Selenoid].
. To get downloaded file via Ggr just use the same request but with the session ID returned to test:

     $ curl http://ggr-host.example.com:4444/download/<test-session-id>/filename.txt
